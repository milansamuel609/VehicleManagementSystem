# VehicleManagementSystem

This is a simple Vehicle Management System project developed in Java using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## About This Project
While the project itself is straightforward, it represents a significant learning milestone for me. The real value is in building a complete project from scratch, without relying on AI assistance or copy-pasting. This process helped me deeply understand OOP concepts and sharpen my Java programming skills.

Additionally, I integrated a simple DevOps pipeline to automate the build and test process, bringing a taste of real-world software development practices into this project.

## Features:
i) Add new vehicles dynamically (cars and bikes)

ii) Search vehicles by brand

iii) Display all vehicles in the system

iv) Delete vehicles by brand/model

## Technologies Used:
i) Java (Core OOP concepts)

ii) ArrayList for data management

iii) Scanner for user input

iv) Basic DevOps pipeline integration (CI/CD)

## How to Run:
i) Clone the repository
